        We adopted a <strong>Scrum-inspired methodology</strong>, holding 
        <strong> four meetings per week</strong>. These check-ins allowed us to track progress, 
        identify blockers, and ensure the team stayed aligned.

        While lightweight, this approach gave us the flexibility of Agile while maintaining a 
        structured schedule to meet deadlines.
